      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Beatriz, a first-generation Latina and Computer Science graduate
        passionate about building quality technology. I bring hands-on
        experience in software quality assurance, working on everything from
        Windows on ARM to autonomous vehicle simulation at NVIDIA. With a strong
        foundation in Python, C++, and CI/CD, I've helped streamline testing
        processes and ensure reliable, high-performance software. I'm excited
        about innovative solutions, collaborative engineering, and continuing to
        break barriers in tech.

          I performed comprehensive QA testing for Windows on ARM systems
          powered by custom N1X chipsets, focusing on hardware, software, and
          platform stability. My work included validating the functionality of
          all system I/O ports to ensure compliance with user experience
          standards, executing Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity testing across
          multiple scenarios and stress conditions to guarantee consistent
          performance and reliability, and leading thermal testing efforts by
          collaborating with the hardware team to analyze heat dissipation,
          throttling behavior, and power profiles under sustained workloads.

          Collaborated with engineering teams to conduct manual and automated
          software testing for SimReady Studio in NVIDIA Omniverse. Developed
          and implemented automated testing solutions to improve software
          testing efficiency. Utilized Python for creating automated tests,
          participated in test plan development, daily build testing, and
          regression monitoring. Provided feedback to developers and maintained
          issue tracking via JIRA and NVbugs. Streamlined testing processes,
          leading to a significant reduction in testing time and increased
          software reliability by 60%.
